#Before you get started building an App, first you should begin with making notes about how you want the layout to be and which steps you want to take first.
I started with my Random.js Component, cause personally i like getting the hard part first. so i started with fetching the data and displaying it on the app.
then i moved on to Search.js and Grid.js, i took the grid layout from a package, and mapped the data there.
After i finished those i went on to the Buttons.js, i personally wanted every component to appear at a button onClick so that's what i did personally.

Then i reached the CSS and finished designing the site.
